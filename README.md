# Maven-Environmental-Challenge

In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.

## Task
To visualize Apple's progress toward meeting their 2030 goal of reaching carbon neutrality across their corporate operations and entire product life cycle
